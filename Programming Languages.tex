            \subsection{History}
            \textbf{Java} is a programming Language that was created/developed by JAMES GOSLING. He with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton (Green Team) initiated the \textbf{Java} Language project in June 1991.It was initially called GREENTALK the it was changed to OAK then finally textbf{JAVA} in 1995.It was initially designed for small, embedded systems.
